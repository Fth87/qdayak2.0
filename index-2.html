                    trees.Chopsticks are made of wooden trees that have a round shape with a length of 2 meters.The stem diameter is 2 cm, and the diameter 1 cm hole.While chopstick bullets (smeared with poisons) are made of bamboo or a
                    type of old palm tree.Dayak Culture's poisonous chopsticks are not only deadly with poison.But also makes people Exposed to seizures in a terrible way.People affected by chopsticks will usually die in minutes.They will
                    seizure while removing dirt or urine before later Killed.Usually this chopstick will be directed to the target neck.That way the opponent will die quickly and sadistically.The troops called ghost troops here are Dayak
                    Culture.There are two reasons why This Dayak Culture troops are very scary and deadly that they are called ghost troops.First, Dayak Culture has an understanding of excellent forests.They are native of Kalimantan, so
                    Dayak troops are very good at controlling the battlefield.Second, Dayak Culture forces certainly have a deadly weapon, chopsticks.Thanks to the silence and ability of Dayak Culture in killing the opponent, then The
                    troops are quite appropriate if called ghost troops.Thanks to the ferocity and horror of weapons possessed by Dayak Culture, the interior of Kalimantan can live comfortably without intervention from people foreign.Dayak
                    Culture's ability to attack enemies can make Dutch troops not attack the interior of Kalimantan.They only exist to control big cities.

                    Beji
                  </h1>
                  <p class="isi-modal">
                    Earlier, two leaders named Single Beji and Tumenggung Marubai.These two people have a very backdrop.The Marubai Tumenggung is a good and not arrogant person. Meanwhile, Single Beji is a magical, greedy and arrogant
                    man.Both have livelihoods as fish seekers and have their own territories.Tumenggung Marubai and his followers looking for Fish in the Simpang Melawi River, while the bachelor is in Sungal Simpang Kapuas.West Kalimantan
                    People's Fair The Story of the Sungai Simpang Melawi Region has many types of fish, more than Fish in the Sungal Simpang Kapuas.That is why, the Basil catching the marubai is always more than the single.Tumenggung Melawi
                    uses trap or a large trap to catch fish. After accumulating in the trap, it only chooses large fish, while the small fish are released again so the fish in the Sungal Simpang Melawi are always growing and never running
                    out.

                    <img src="images/modal-bujang1.jpg" alt="modal-bujang1.jpg" class="modal-img my-2" />
                    Seeing the catch of Tumenggung Marubai, Bujang Beji felt jealous.He was also looking for ways to defeat Tumenggung Melawi.Then, he took a bad way.He began to catch fish by menguba, which is poisoning The fish with tubes,
                    which are a type of fish toxins from the roots of forest plants that are very intoxicating.At first, he got a lot of fish.More than the catch of Tumenggung Marubai. However, because the way used is to kill fish with
                    poisons, over time the fish in the Simpang Kapuas river becomes greatly reduced.Meanwhile, Tumenggung Marubai still gets a lot of results catch.This makes Bujang Beji more jealous."This can't be left!"Bujang Beji
                    thought, "There must be a way so that Tumenggung Marubai doesn't get much fish."Then, Bujang Beji began to think hard. He found the best way he thought."I have to close the Melawi River flow with a large stone upstream
                    of the river, thus the fish will settle there," said Bujang Beji.
                    <br />

                    Bujang Beji intends to use the Peak of Bukit Batu in Nanga Silat, Kapuas Hulu to clog the Melawi River.With his supernatural powers, he cut the peak of the stone hill and carried it using seven leaves weeds.While
                    carrying the stone hill, suddenly the sound of the girls was laughing at him.They are goddesses in the land of Khayangan.When it reached the intersection between Kapuas and Malawi, Bujang Beji looked up to see who
                    laughed at him.Unintentionally, his feet stepped on toxic thorns until La jumped and screamed in pain.As a result, the seven pieces of weeds he used cut off.The peak of the stone hill fell in a river called the Jetak.
                    <img src="images/modal-bujang2.jpg" alt="modal-bujang2.jpg" class="modal-img my-2" />
                    Bujang Beji was very angry at the goddess who laughed at him."I'll reply to you guys!"he shouted as he stomped his feet pierced by a poisonous thorn on one of the hills nearby.Then, Bujang Beji tried to lift the stone
                    hill that had been submerged in the Jetak by prying it using a longitudinal hill.However, because the stone hill was attached to the Jetak, his efforts were unsuccessful.Hill Elongated that was broken.The fault is now
                    called Bukit Liut.Thus, Bujang Beji's business failed to close the Melawi River.All because of the goddesses.I will take revenge, "said Bujang Benji.Bujang Benji plans to reach the land of Khayangan by using a mambu
                    kumpang tree, which is a kind of giant wood tree that ends up to the sky.He started planting mambu kumpang trees.Within a few days only the tree has grown very tall, until the peak is not visible to the eyes.Before
                    climbing the mambu kumpang, Bujang Beji performed a traditional ritual, which gave offerings to the spirits and animals in The surroundings so as not to disturb their business to reach the land of Khayangan.However,
                    there are two types of animals that forget to be given offerings by Bujang Beji, they are a termite and bear group.Termites and bears feel angry, because it is not given offerings.They also negotiated to frustrate Bujang
                    Beji's business."Let's just be stuck in the mambu kumpang tree until it is cut off!"Bear proposal.The termite group agreed.When Bujang Beji starts Climbing the mambu kumpang tree, a group of termite and bear coming to
                    storm and eat away at the bottom until the tree is cut off.At that time, Bujang Beji had almost reached the country Khayangan.He also crashed into the ground and died instantly.Thus, Bujang Beji's efforts to harm the
                    Goddess of Khayangan failed.Tumenggung Marubai also avoided the evil intentions of Bujang Beji.Meanwhile, The hilltop of Nanga Silat which is separated from the Bachelor Beji punch transformed into a dark hill.Now the
                    dark hill is one of the attractions in the Sintang area, West Kalimantan, and is a tourist forest area with very beautiful scenery.

                    Finally, Nusa and his sister -in -law went to hunt in the Ruhan River, a small river in the Kahayan River.On the way, they were blocked by trees that fell towards the river.They also pulled over and tried to cut down
                    trees That.Because the day was getting late, they finally divided the tasks, Nusa's sister -in -law continued to cut down trees, while Nusa entered the forest to hunt.In the forest, Nusa found a large egg and then
                    brought it The giant egg returned home.Nusa's wife was worried because the eggs brought by Nusa were very large, moreover the eggs were not known to come from what animal.According to him, they should not eat the eggs.
                    But Nusa believes it is different and still wants to eat the giant egg.Nusa also boiled the egg and ate it until it runs out.But something happened, Nusa's body was filled with red spots that were painful and
                    itchy.Moment Scratched, the spots turned into scales.Nusa's body enlarged and felt hot.He asked to be put into the river.With the help of local residents, Nusa's sister -in -law brought Nusa to the Drying Kahayan River.
                    In the water, Nusa's body turned into a large dragon.Nusa then advised his wife to invite his younger siblings and villagers to evacuate, because that night the storm would rain.So heavy storm rain In the evening, until
                    Nusa's body which has become a large dragon was carried by the river current, until finally stranded near the river mouth.The arrival of Nusa made the fish in the estuary anxious because they became prey. Until one day,
                    jelawat fish and Saluang fish were looking for ways to save the fish so as not to be eaten by Nusa Si Dragon.The fish also run plans to expel Nusa.One of a Saluang fish tells Nusa that there are other dragons who
                    challenged it, even though it was only the tricks of the fish.The next day, Nusa prepared to wait for the dragon to challenge her.But strangely, that day there were no river fish passing by.Because The dragon awaited
                    Nusa did not arrive, he fell asleep.Saluang fish that had been observing from a distance approached him and woke up Nusa, he said that his enemy had come.Nusa was panicked and direct Looking where his enemy, when he saw
                    the tail, he immediately bit it.But apparently Nusa bit his own tail until it broke!Seeing this, Saluang fish immediately told thousands of fish in the river to Attacking the tail of the Nusa Nusa who was injured in his
                    body.Naga Nusa also tried to escape from the pursuit of thousands of fish to exhaustion and finally he died.The fish ate the dragon until the skeleton lives.Framework Naga Nusa has gradually overgrown with shrubs and
                    becomes an island.The island was finally known as the island of Nusa.
